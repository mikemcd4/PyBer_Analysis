# Pyber Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

Pyber is a ridesharing company looking to stand out in a highly competitive market, and is wanting to conduct analysis to better understand customers' tendencies, market behaviors, and profit trends. Uncovering these things within the data will both help consumers looking to maximize their value and efficiency of the service, and drivers who are looking to maximize their profits. The specific goal of this specific analysis was to see how data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

2. Incentivize riders to use rideshare services in more rural areas, incentivize drivers to drive in urban areas
3. Focus finances more on urban sector of business than rural
